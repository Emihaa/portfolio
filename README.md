## Course lecturer at Xamk, University of Applied Sciences

I have two courses that I have been teaching since the beginning of 2024. *3D Environment Design & 3D Character Design*
In both courses, I combine artistic principles with technical workflows, giving students skills and creativity to bring their ideas to life, but also the technical understanding needed for the pipeline of game production. My goal as a teacher is also to share practical knowledge and industry insight for students that wish to enter the game industry and find their footing.
